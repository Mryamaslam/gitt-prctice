# Code Explanation: Exploring User's Favorite Numbers

## Step 1: Taking User Input
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
num_1 = int(input("Enter your first favourite number: "))
num_2 = int(input("Enter your second favourite number: "))
num_3 = int(input("Enter your third favourite number: "))
print(f"Hello, {name}! Let's explore your favourite numbers:")
```
- This part of the code asks the user for their name and three favorite numbers.
- The `input()` function takes input as a string, so the numbers are converted to integers using `int()`.
- After collecting the inputs, it greets the user by name.

## Step 2: Creating a List of Numbers
```python
numbers = [num_1, num_2, num_3]
```
- This step creates a list called `numbers` that contains the three integers entered by the user. This makes it easier to process them collectively in the next steps.

## Step 3: Identifying Even or Odd Numbers
```python
even_odd_list = [(num, "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd") for num in numbers]
for num, kind in even_odd_list:
    print(f"The number {num} is {kind}.")
```
- This part checks if each number is even or odd.
- It uses a **list comprehension** to create a list `even_odd_list` where each number is paired with a label ("even" or "odd").
- It then loops through the list and prints whether each number is even or odd.

## Step 4: Calculating the Square of Each Number
```python
squares = [(num, num ** 2) for num in numbers]
for num, square in squares:
    print(f"The square of {num} is ({num},{square}).")
```
- This code calculates the square of each number in the list.
- It again uses a list comprehension to generate a list of tuples, pairing each number with its square.
- The `for` loop then prints the original number and its square in a readable format.

## Step 5: Calculating the Sum of the Numbers
```python
total_sum = sum(numbers)
print(f"
Amazing! The sum of your favorite numbers is: {total_sum}")
```
- The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of all three numbers.
- The result is stored in the variable `total_sum` and printed with a message.

## Step 6: Checking if the Sum is Prime (Initialization)
```python
is_prime = True
if total_sum <= 1:
    is_prime = False
```
- This initializes a variable `is_prime` to `True`, assuming the sum is prime by default.
- Then, a condition checks if the sum is less than or equal to 1. If so, it sets `is_prime` to `False` since numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.

## Step 7: Checking if the Sum is Prime (Loop for Divisibility)
```python
else:
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(total_sum)) + 1):
        if total_sum % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
```
- If the sum is greater than 1, this loop checks if it's divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `total_sum`.
- The logic uses `math.sqrt()` to reduce the number of iterations, as divisors will be found within this range if they exist.
- If any divisor is found, `is_prime` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks early to save processing time.

## Step 8: Printing the Prime Check Result
```python
if is_prime:
    print(f"Wow! The sum {total_sum} is a prime number!")
else:
    print(f"The sum {total_sum} is not a prime number!")
```
- After checking for prime status, this step prints whether the sum is a prime number based on the value of `is_prime`.
- If `is_prime` is `True`, it congratulates the user for having a prime sum, otherwise, it informs them that the sum is not prime.
